Hello! My name is Luke Watts, and this is my first data analytics case study - completed as the capstone project for my Google Data Analytics Certification. 

In this report I will walk you through the steps I took as I verified, cleaned, processed, and analysed the data. I will then share with you my insights and the conclusions that I made that informed my recommendations for the Cyclistic marketing team and shareholders.

We will follow the established 6 step process of data analysis - Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share, and finally Act.


## What is the scenario?


#### An excerpt from the case study notes;

You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share
company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to
understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these
insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be
backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

#### Key Stakeholders

Lily Moreno, the founder of Cyclistic
Executive Team
Marketing Analytics Team (your department)

#### Cyclistic Background Info

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown
to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations
across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station
in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to
broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the
flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable
than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers,
Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.
Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes
there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders
are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into
annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how
annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how
digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in
analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
Let us begin...

## Step 1: Ask


Business Task: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
Of all the business questions, I have been assigned to answer the first one. Hence, I will focus on analysing the relationships in the data between the annual members and casual riders.

## Step 2: Prepare


To conduct an in depth analysis, we must obtain the Cyclistic historical data trips from December 2023 to November 2024, from [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under [this license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)
Datasets have been downloaded and stored locally in a folder “202312–202411_Cyclistic”
All 12 Data sets are standardized and have the same 12 columns of information
Due to data privacy issues, personal information has been removed / encrypted

#### Perform ROCCC check: 

Data is reliable  as it us unbiased and represents the population fairly due to having a large sample size. Data is original (Cyclistic is a fictional company so technically data is actually not original but can be considered so for the purpose of this case study). Data is comprehensive- we have a full data set for the time frame stated and all the info we need to answer the business task. Data is current, from the last year up until present day. Data is not cited, but has been vetted by Motivate International Inc.

Use R Studio to aggregate and manipulate the data, as in total, the combined dataset will be large in scale.

#### Setting up the environment

Set the working directory to the local folder where the datasets are

```{r}
knitr::opts_knit$set(file_location <- "C:/Users/lukew/Desktop/Case Study 1 - Cyclistic (R)/202312–202411_Cyclistic")
```

Let's load the tidyverse, dplyr, lubridate, and markdown packages

```{r loading packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(rmarkdown)
```

assign all the csv files in the working directory to a variable called "aggregate_files"

```{r assigning csv files}
aggregate_files <- list.files(file_location, full.names = TRUE, pattern = "*.csv")
```

read the .csv files in the aggregate_files variable and map them into a single data frame called "aggregate_dataframe"

```{r mapping first data frame}
aggregate_dataframe <- map_df(aggregate_files, read_csv)
```

#### Initial data observation

lets check the column names for the combined data set as part of our data check

```{r}
colnames(aggregate_dataframe)
```

lets check how many rows in the data frame

```{r}
nrow(aggregate_dataframe)
```

lets check the dimensions of the data frame

```{r}
dim(aggregate_dataframe)
```

lets look at a brief summary of the data frame

```{r}
head(aggregate_dataframe)
```

lets inspect the overall structure of the data

```{r}
str(aggregate_dataframe)
```

lets get a statistical summary of the data by column (note that the total number of N/A or blank entries for each column is also listed)

```{r}
summary(aggregate_dataframe)
```

## Step 3: Process


#### Cleaning

Data check complete. We move on to data cleaning / verification stage. The code chunk below will include multiple pipe operations, explained below, step by step. 
We will store the clean manipulated data in a new data frame called cleaned_cyclistic_data.
Then, we will select the columns that are pertinent for our analysis (omitting the latitude and longitude location data)
Then, we will omit all n/a (blank/empty values)
Then, add new columns using the mutate function that list the date, month name & weekday of each ride, as we might need to aggregate ride data for each of these
Then, create a trip duration column using the difference in time between the started_at and ended_at trip columns (in minutes), formatted as a numeric data type

```{r creating the new clean data frame}
cleaned_cyclistic_data <- aggregate_dataframe %>%
  select("ride_id", "rideable_type", "started_at", "ended_at",
         "start_station_name", "end_station_name", "member_casual") %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(started_at),
         month = format(as.Date(started_at), "%B"),
         weekday = format(as.Date(started_at), "%A"),
         trip_duration = as.numeric(difftime(ended_at, started_at, units = "mins")))
```

perform data check of the new trip_duration column

```{r clean df check}
min(cleaned_cyclistic_data$trip_duration)
max(cleaned_cyclistic_data$trip_duration)
```

min and max functions reveal erroneous data - trip duration cannot be negative, and trip duration longer than one day is not relevant to this analysis 
(probably bikes being removed for servicing or similar reasons)
we will store the filtered data in a new data frame called filtered_cyclistic_data.
select all original columns, plus the six newly generated columns
then filter out the undesirable results using the filter function so that 1 minute <= duration <= 1 day

```{r filtering df}
filtered_cyclistic_data <- cleaned_cyclistic_data %>%
  select("ride_id", "rideable_type", "started_at", "ended_at",
         "start_station_name", "end_station_name", "member_casual", "date", "month", "weekday", "trip_duration") %>% 
  filter(trip_duration >= 1, trip_duration <= (24*60))
```

#### Verification

let us do a quick verfication check of the cleaned data

are there any N/A values remaining?

```{r}
colSums(is.na(filtered_cyclistic_data))
```

this confirms there are 0 N/A values

We then proceed to check if there are any duplicate "ride_id" entries and remove them

```{r}
any(duplicated(filtered_cyclistic_data$ride_id))
```

duplicate IDs exist so let us remove those by using the distinct function and assigning the output to a second filtered data frame

```{r creating second filtered df}
filtered_df_v2 <- filtered_cyclistic_data %>%
  distinct(ride_id, .keep_all=TRUE)
```

121 duplicate IDs have been removed so let us run the duplicate check again

```{r}
any(duplicated(filtered_df_v2$ride_id))
```

returned result is FALSE, so no duplicates exist

recheck the trip_duration values to ensure that time frame is between 1 minute and 24 hours

```{r}
min(filtered_df_v2$trip_duration)
max(filtered_df_v2$trip_duration)
```

duration is confirmed as being between 1 and 1439 minutes

dataset has been reduced in size from 5906269 to 4202340 rows, which is approx 29%

Lastly, we want to check the structure of our new data frame and see if there are data types that do not match our column type

```{r}
str(filtered_df_v2)
```

data types are confirmed to be correct, so we can move on to the analyse stage

## Step 4: Analyse


Now lets go back to our business question and try to answer it: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

With our data, we can extract key information that will help us answer this question. Here’s how we can approach it using the available data:

#### Comparing the number of rides per month 

We can analyze and compare the monthly ride counts between casual riders and members.

let us use ggplot2 to visualise this data as a bar graph:
the factor function reorders the months chronologically
the position="dodge" function arranges the columns for rider type side by side, rather than stacked
the labs(fill) function is the legend formatting function
the scale_y_continuous function formats the y axis scale from exponential to hundreds of thousands, to make it easier to interpret for the average stakeholder / employee

```{r plotting the monthly riders bar graph, out.width= "150%", echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=filtered_df_v2)+ 
  geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=factor(month, levels = c("January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December")), fill=member_casual), position="dodge")+
  labs(title = "Cyclistic: member riders vs. casual riders", subtitle = "total number of rides, per month", caption = "Dec 2023 - Nov 2024", x = "Months", fill = "Rider type")+
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Rider count (thousands)", labels = function(y) y / 1000)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

The hotter period of the year (especially the months of June, July, August, September) have the highest number of rides for casual riders and members
Member numbers remain high from May-October, an even longer period
This pattern suggests that around the summer season, when there is typically sunnier weather/less rainfall, bike usage tends to increase
This attracts both casual riders and members to utilize the bikes more frequently

#### Now, we can also compare bike usage on days of the week

We can discover how casual riders and members differ in their bike usage on different days of the week using a similar approach
instead of using the position="dodge" function, we will use facet_wrap to seperate the data for casual and member riders into 2 individual graphs
the guides(fill="none") argument removes the legend, which is not necessary

```{r plotting the bar graph for daily rider data, out.width= "150%", echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=filtered_df_v2)+ 
  geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=factor(weekday, levels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")), fill=member_casual))+ 
  facet_wrap(~ member_casual)+
  labs(title = "Cyclistic: member riders vs. casual riders", subtitle = "total number of rides, per weekday", caption = "Dec 2023 - Nov 2024", x = "Day", fill = "Rider type")+
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Rider count (thousands)", labels = function(y) y / 1000)+
  guides(fill="none")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

By analyzing the two graphs, we can clearly observe a distinct difference in bike usage between casual riders and members
Casual riders usage tends to peak on weekends. This could indicate that casual riders are those people who are likely to use the bikes for the purpose of leisure / recreational activities / exploration during their free time
Members bike usage shows a gradual peak during weekdays. It also shows higher and more consistent use overall. This implies that members use the bikes for their transportation or work commute

#### Next, let us use ggplot2 to visualise the top 5 most popular start and end stations

If working with tableau, I would creates heatmaps of this data, but within R some simple bar graphs will suffice
First let us create two new dataframes to reorder the data, called top_five_start and top_five_end

```{r creating dfs for the 5 most popular stations}
top_five_start <- filtered_df_v2 %>% 
  group_by(start_station_name, member_casual) %>% 
  summarize(row_count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(row_count))

top_five_end <- filtered_df_v2 %>% 
  group_by(end_station_name, member_casual) %>% 
  summarize(row_count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(row_count))
```
```{r plotting the 4 bar graphs for start & end stations, for both casual and member riders, echo=FALSE}
top_five_start %>% 
  filter(member_casual == "member") %>%
  head(5) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(mapping=aes(x=fct_rev(fct_reorder(start_station_name, row_count)), y=row_count), fill="purple")+
  labs(title = "Cyclistic: Top 5 start stations", subtitle = "Members", caption = "Dec 2023 - Nov 2024",x="Start Station", y="Ride Count")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 10))

top_five_start %>% 
  filter(member_casual == "casual") %>%
  head(5) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(mapping=aes(x=fct_rev(fct_reorder(start_station_name, row_count)), y=row_count), fill="orange")+
  labs(title = "Cyclistic: Top 5 start stations", subtitle = "Casuals", caption = "Dec 2023 - Nov 2024",x="Start Station", y="Ride Count")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 10))

top_five_end %>% 
  filter(member_casual == "member") %>%
  head(5) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(mapping=aes(x=fct_rev(fct_reorder(end_station_name, row_count)), y=row_count), fill="purple")+
  labs(title = "Cyclistic: Top 5 end stations", subtitle = "Members", caption = "Dec 2023 - Nov 2024",x="End Station", y="Ride Count")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 10))

top_five_end %>% 
  filter(member_casual == "casual") %>%
  head(5) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(mapping=aes(x=fct_rev(fct_reorder(end_station_name, row_count)), y=row_count), fill="orange")+
  labs(title = "Cyclistic: Top 5 end stations", subtitle = "Casuals", caption = "Dec 2023 - Nov 2024",x="End Station", y="Ride Count")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 10))
```

Upon looking at the bar charts, it is apparent that both casual riders and members exhibit distinct top 5 stations
Implies that while the specific stations may differ between the two groups, there *is* consistency
We can focus on that consistency when it comes to advertising campaigns and increasing revenue from both groups

Interestingly, the starting stations and ending stations for each group are almost identical -
Top 4 "members" start & end stations are the same, with only #5 being a different station 
All 5 "casual" riders start & end stations are the same, with just a reversal in order for #3 and #4 most popular stations
Member riders are far more evenly distributed between the most popular stations - only a few thousand riders seperate #1 and #5
Whereas casual riders hugely prefer starting and ending journeys at "Streeter Drive & Grand Avenue" 
They are almost twice as numerous at #1 compared to #2-#5

#### Next, we can perform trip duration analysis. We can compare the trip lengths of casual riders and annual members

This analysis can provide insights into the average duration of rides for each group

```{r grouping data for trip duration analysis}
filtered_df_v2 %>% 
  group_by(member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(mean(trip_duration))
```

Running the above code returns the result that casual riders use the service for TWICE as long as member riders (24.2 mins vs 12.6 mins)
This result further supports the theory that casual riders use the bikes for leisure/recreation, and members use them for commuting purposes
We have derived valuable insights from analysis so we can move on to the final "Act" stage

The advertising team should take a 3 pronged approach: 

i) "Summer Spike" - deploy a seasonal advertising campaign in April / May to capitalize on the predicted uptick in bike usage during the hotter half of the year
ii) "The Big 5" - increased advertising at the most frequently used stations to take advantage of their popularity / high traffic for each rider type
iii) "Casual Courting" - enhance the appeal of weekend riding for casual riders by tying weekend bike rentals to other activities (e.g. using coupons for other businesses),
or by offering weekend discounts or promotional offers

##Share & Act

In reality, this is the stage where these findings would be presented to the shareholders - the founder Lily Moreno and the executive team. After answering questions and taking feedback, we would either revisit and adapt the process and do further analysis, or proceed to act on the recommendations put forward.

This denotes the end of my first case study. Woohoo!
